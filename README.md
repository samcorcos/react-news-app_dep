# React-Webpack template
**last updated December 2015**

It's hard to keep track of the latest best practices with React and Webpack. This is a basic template that I'm going to try to keep up to date. This is exclusively frontend.

## Installation

`git clone <this repo>`

`npm install && npm start`
